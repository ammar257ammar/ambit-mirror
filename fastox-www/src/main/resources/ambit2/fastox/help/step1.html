In the first step of the ToxPredict workflow you can select the structure(s) for which you would like to apply some OpenTox model(s). The "Search", "Draw" and "Upload" tabs below provide different ways for structure selection:
<ul>
	<li> SEARCH tab: You can enter any free text, including but not limited to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_registry_number" target="_blank">CAS registry number</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EINECS" target="_blank">EINECS number</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular_input_line_entry_specification" target="_blank">SMILES</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inchi" target="_blank">InChI</a>, chemical name, any keyword; ToxPredict will automatically recognize the intended search type and return zero, one or more hits, depending on the search type, the information currently available in the OpenTox database and the selected preferred number of hits.
	<li> DRAW tab: You can draw a chemical structure in the built-in editor and perform exact structure or substructure search, or structural similarity based search; ToxPredict will return zero, one or more hits, depending on the search type, the information currently available in the OpenTox database and the selected preferred number of hits.
  <li> UPLOAD tab: You can upload your own dataset(s); ToxPredict accepts SDF, MOL, CSV and RDF file formats, among many others.
</ul>
Once you've entered your query string, chemical structure drawing or file name for upload, press NEXT to proceed to the following step.
