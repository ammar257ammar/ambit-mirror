ToxPredict estimates the chemical hazard of chemical structures. It relies on OpenTox API-v1.1 compliant RESTful webservices. 
Users can either search the OpenTox prototype database, which includes currently quality labelled data for X chemicals, grouped in Y datasets, or upload their own chemical structure data. ToxPredict provides access to X ready to use models, addressing Y endpoints. The ToxCreate sister application allows more advanced users to train new OpenTox models.
