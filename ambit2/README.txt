We are going to do a major redesign of Ambit code in next months. This will be the place for the new code.

Build is based on ant.

 all             Compiles and builds ambit2 jars (to be found in dist directory)

 clean           Removes autogenerated files.
 compile-smarts  Compile smarts package
 compile-tests   Compile tests package
 run-smarts      Run smarts
 smarts          Compiles ambit-smarts-vX.X.jar package
 srcdist         Source distribution.
 srcdist1        Backs up all source into a ambit2-source-vX.X-date.zip file (di
st directory).
 test            Run junit tests
 test-html       Run tests and generate HTML report (to be found in reports dire
ctory)
 test-smarts     Run junit tests for smarts package, console output
 tests           Compiles ambit-tests-vX.X.jar package
Default target: all
