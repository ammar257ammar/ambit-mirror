				There are four role types: Author, Reviewer, Chief Editor and Administrator, which can be assigned to the registered users.
				</help>
				<help>
				The Author can create and submit QMRF documents. Once submitted, the documents are reviewed by a Reviewer.
				The Reviewer can publish the document, or return it to the Author, if there is insufficient/unclear information.

				This can be done via the User profiles tab.
				</help>
				<help>
				Note: The Author role can not be removed if there are documents under preparation (e.g. draft, under_revision, submitted, returned for revision).
