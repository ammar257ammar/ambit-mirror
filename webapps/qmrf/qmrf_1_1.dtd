APPLICABILITY DOMAIN refers to the response and chemical structure space in which the model makes predictions with a given reliability. Ideally the applicability domain should express the structural, physicochemical and response space of the model. The CHEMICAL STRUCTURE (x variable) space can be expressed by information on physicochemical properties and/or structural fragments. The RESPONSE (y variable) can be any physicochemical, biological or environmental effect that is being predicted. According to PRINCIPLE 3 a (Q)SAR should be associated with a defined domain of applicability. Section 5 can be repeated (e.g., 5.a, 5.b, 5.c, etc) as many time as necessary if more than one method has been used to assess the applicability domain.">
