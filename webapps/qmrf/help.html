The set of information that you provide will be used to facilitate regulatory considerations of (Q)SARs. For this purpose, the structure of the QMRF is devised to reflect as much as possible the OECD principles for the validation, for regulatory purposes, of (Q)SAR models.
Please, try to fill in the fields of the QMRF for the model of interest. If the field is not pertinent with the model you are describing, or if you cannot provide the requested information, please answer “no information available”.

You are invited to consult the OECD <a href="http://ecb.jrc.it/qsar/background/index.php?c=OECD" target="_blank">"Guidance document on the Validation of (Quantitative) Structure-Activity Relationship Models"</a>	that can aid you in filling in a number of fields of the QMRF.

	QMRF number is an unique number (numeric identifier) is assigned to any QMRF that is published in the ECB inventory. The number encodes the following information: model described in the QMRF (as derived from field 4.2), software implementing the model (as derived from field 1.3), version of the QMRF for the same model and the same software (as derived from the information included in field 2.4) and author of the QMRF (as derived from field 2.2). The number is unique for any QMRF uploaded and stored in the ECB inventory.<br>
	Click "Retrieve number from catalog" to obtain corresponding numbers.<br>
